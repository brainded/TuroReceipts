# TuroReceipts

A C# port of [turo-automation](https://github.com/dangoldin/turo-automation) with a few changes. 

## Prerequisites

As long as you have Windows, Chrome and .Net runtime 4.6 installed you should be good to go. 

## Running

To get started

- download [Release v1.0](https://github.com/brainded/TuroReceipts/releases/tag/v1.0) and unzip the contents to your computer
- open the TuroReceipts.exe.config file with your favorite text editor and enter your login credentials and save
- double click the exe and you will be prompted for the number of receipts to download
- once done it will open a CSV file with the data scrapped from Turo

## Gotchas

I didn't have any cancelations on my account to test with so there may be issues. 
If you choose to open an issue do me a favor and upload the html of the receipt.
